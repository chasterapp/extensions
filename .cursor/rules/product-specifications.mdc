# Chaster Extensions Product Specifications

## Overview
This repository serves as a central hub for developing and maintaining extensions for the Chaster platform. Chaster is a keyholding application for chastity wearers and keyholders, and this repository aims to provide a collaborative space for developers to create and improve extensions that enhance the Chaster experience.

## Initial Extensions
The repository will initially focus on three core extensions:
1. **Card Game Extension**: A game-based extension that adds an element of chance and entertainment to the lock experience
2. **Emergency Unlock Extension**: A safety-focused extension that provides controlled emergency access options
3. **Keyholder AI Chat Extension**: An AI-powered communication system that simulates interaction with a keyholder

## Technical Foundation
All extensions in this repository will be built using the official Chaster Extensions API, ensuring compatibility and proper integration with the Chaster platform. The API provides endpoints for:
- Extension session management
- Lock configuration
- User authentication
- Real-time updates via webhooks
